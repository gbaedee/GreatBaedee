    <div>
        <p>My name is Great Leh Baedee and I’m currently a junior at Texas Southern University.
            I’m study Computer Science and computer Engineering Technology. I have teaching kids
            from middle to high school how to create Android Applications since December 2014,
            Aside from that I was the Vice- President and Secretary of Cyber Internet Society
            Student Association (CISSA); which we introduce and enhance our knowledge of cyber
            security practices as well as the Kali Linux Operating System environment.
            Additionally, this helps me expose myself to real world penetration testing scenarios
            through testing a mock network, establishing honeypots, and exposing users to the use
            of Virtual Machines. Right now I’m the secretary of Texas Southern University’s Mobile
            Application Development Group (TSU MAD) in which we introduce and enhance our software
            development capability in the mobile application environment that will promote
            entrepreneurship. We expose ourselves to real world software development process
            through actual software product development, which sharpened my programming skills
            on real world problems.</p></div>

                your readers in following a piece of writing. You can have fantastic ideas,
